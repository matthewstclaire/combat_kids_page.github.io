        Welcome to the Combat Arts Kids page. This was designed to help new
        parents and students get comfortable with their early experiences at
        Combat Arts.

      <p>
        Here you will find videos and links to learn more about what to expect
        when getting started. It can be an extremely nerve-wracking experience
        starting out, but we know once you and your child get through the
        introductions and initial awkwardness you both will have found a
        lifelong hobby.
